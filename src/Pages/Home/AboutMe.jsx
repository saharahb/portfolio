            I'm a computer science student located in Vancouver, BC who is
            seeking Fall 2024 internships. I am currently completing my second
            Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of British
            Columbia, in the BCS program. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science
            in Biology in May of 2023 and I worked in genetics research for over
            a year before discovering my love for tech. I have a passion for
            lifelong learning and I look forward to making meaningful
            contributions to the tech industry!

            Outside of academics, I enjoy attending hackathons and building cool
            projects. In my free time you can either find me with my nose in a
            book, on a run, or in the front row at a concert!
